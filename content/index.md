> [!note]- Look at Wolverine?
> You see a wolverine digging intently at a patch of dirt, before gingerly placing a sapling into the hole it made. It smooths out the soil with its snout, before making eye contact with you. It lets out a low *chirp* before shuffling off to the other side of the garden. It seems content for you to explore the garden it's made.

Welcome to my digital garden. I'm having a great time building it. Maybe you'll have a good time walking around it? Take anything you like back home with you, and leave me anything you think I'll like.
