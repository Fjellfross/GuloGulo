- Full Title: Advice for a Friend Who Wants to Start a Blog
- Category: #articles
- Summary: When starting a blog, focus on what makes you unique and express your true self rather than trying to fit in with others. Write about your interests and experiences in a way that feels natural and fun, even if it means making mistakes. Remember, your blog is a space to explore your thoughts freely, and you'll attract readers who appreciate your authenticity.

## Highlights
- So don’t think too much about how it’s supposed to be done, what others are doing, or what the conventions demand. Just try to amuse yourself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1kjx9y1adbavy4sqw71trs))
- Your contradictions are an asset. You’re a lover of classical English architecture *and* you’re also a dirty little punk—expressing both at the same time is more interesting than sharing *just* cute pictures of English gardens or *just* wild trashy stuff. The more you incorporate everything that love and that comes easily for you (your interests, your sense of humor, your grammatical tics, etc), the more your style emerges.

- Not that many people will care about what you write, at least for the first few years, so make the writing useful to you. Write in a way that lets you [refine your thoughts about the things that matter](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/writing-to-think). Write to experience what you care about in higher resolution—write to enhance your feeling of aliveness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1kkrjw1garwy35x5wyzpgx))
- This, however, is not an excuse to be lazy in your thinking. You have to put your thoughts in order. But the time to do this is *before* you write for publication. Think: musicians practicing hard so they can be in the moment when they improvise. Read, take notes, study, question yourself. But then, when writing a post, let that go, and rely on the brain power you have accumulated. A good essay is an interesting mind wrestling with a problem in somewhat real-time. *(I should add, for context, that my friend and I are talking about writing beautiful essays here. If you want to write the most precise thing possible, you need to edit mercilessly and accept that the writing ends up flat and disjointed.)* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1kmjsdtf3p267j8k9fvv70))
- Another simple format is a list, like this essay. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1knkpc4t148f24nyxhq064))
- A good question to ask yourself when you edit: what is the weakest 20 percent of this draft? Cut it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1kpvp4x9ycw08cc9tjfe3e))
