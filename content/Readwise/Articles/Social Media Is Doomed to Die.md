## Highlights
- Sadly, this story is not just about Snap. It’s about a pattern that all social media apps seem doomed to repeat — to veer from their initial promise of a place to connect and share with friends and family, toward [something entirely different](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/). How is it possible that social media apps always seem fated to manipulate and disappoint us? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jp150svv6k8ky5ky94k550c8))
- Each platform began honorably, with young founders enthusiastically revealing that *if you aren’t paying for the product, you are the product*. “We’re going to do things differently around here!” they say through a grin. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jp151b8dfsbdmsbrkrw23p74))
- Unlike most other businesses on Earth that live and die by their customers’ demands, social media services are caught trying to satisfy both their users and the people actually paying for it all: investors and advertisers.

- But over the years, I came to think of it as a somewhat radical evolution from an app built and designed for *messaging* to an app for *broadcasting,* like the rest of social media. As I reread that piece I wrote all those years ago, it was actually clear from the beginning that Stories was intended to someday include ads. And once that ad spigot got turned on, the cycle had officially begun. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jp1535dkkye3fy3pcq7cn15p))
- Today, the *product evolution* of social media apps has led to a point where I’m not sure you can even call them *social* anymore — at least not in the way we always knew it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jp1548vsttwbv44pgy7f5dtq))
- “People *want* to be a product!” technology writer [Rob Horning](https://robhorning.substack.com/) wrote to me via email. “Being a product is coded as success in our society… What people don’t want is to be exploited or misled — and that is hard to avoid in the context of ad-supported media.” And so, a bizarre symbiosis is formed between platform, user, and advertiser. The apps had changed, but so had users, leaving that precious early social media feeling out in the cold again. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jp156d88f9thkkmq3aazbbht))
- At the beginning and end and beginning again of all social things, I wonder if *this time* will be different. I wonder if we can build social technology brave enough to treat us like customers, not users. Or simply find a better way to monetize the deep engagement you find on today’s newest content platforms, be it Substack, Patreon, or others. [Julie Young](https://twitter.com/juliey4), always a keen investor and watcher, told me, “Monetizing creator-audience transactions directly is a much higher [average revenue per user] endeavor than monetizing off of advertising.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jp159d7vtkxrcgvxq2wpqrpq))
- However, the promise of ads may simply be too good to turn down. Advertisers are simply willing to pay more for the product than its actual users. In Facebook’s case, the company makes something like [$200 per year](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/Earnings-Presentation-Q4-2022.pdf) of ad revenue on each American user, but how many of those users would pay $15 / month to use Facebook? According to [one study](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/would-people-pay-to-use-social-media-platforms-to-avoid-data-sharing-info/575956/), not many.
