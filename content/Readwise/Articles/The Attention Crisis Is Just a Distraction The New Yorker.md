- Summary: The real issue isn't our ability to focus, but rather what we choose to focus on in today's information-heavy world. Many critics argue that our attention is fragmented by the demands of technology and media, leading to superficial engagement. However, this concern may stem from a deeper anxiety about changing cultural values and the competition between traditional and modern forms of media.

## Highlights
- Such Internet gems are what the poet Patricia Lockwood has called “the sapphires of the instant”; each catches the light in a strange, hypnotic way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1ksm5xznbyrf4v1amr8kmm))
- The arts of attention are a form of self-discipline, but they’re also ways to discipline others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1m18q0px3kmdnqnv716phc))
- Focussing on one’s work and suppressing one’s natural instincts, Lafargue argued, in the eighteen-eighties, was no virtue. It was, rather, to “play the part of the machine” on behalf of one’s own oppressors. Revolutionary consciousness meant asserting “the right to be lazy,” Lafargue insisted. Workers of the world, relax. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1m2hkf9ede7execj1rerra))
- It’s as if we’re not reading books so much as the books are reading us. TikTok is particularly adept at this; you just scroll and the app learns—from your behavior, plus perhaps other information harvested from your phone—about what will keep you hooked.

- Hayes distinguishes between voluntary and compelled attention. Some things we focus on by choice; others, because of our psychological hardwiring, we find hard to ignore. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1m5qb6wn8tg999adav69n4))
- The algorithms deliver what we want but not, as the late philosopher Harry Frankfurt put it, “what we want to want.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1m662xx9v540z8qenmpmze))
- The trouble is “attention capitalism,” Hayes argues, and it has the same dehumanizing effect on consumers’ psyches as industrial capitalism has on workers’ bodies. Successful attention capitalists don’t hold our attention with compelling material but, instead, snatch it over and over with slot-machine gimmicks. They treat us as eyeballs rather than individuals, “cracking into our minds” and leaving us twitching. “Our dominion over our own minds has been punctured,” Hayes writes. “The scale of transformation we’re experiencing is far more vast and more intimate than even the most panicked critics have understood.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1m7qvxqfpj772qz1x6z9ha))
- If reading assignments at top colleges are shorter, it might be because today’s hypercompetitive students are busier, rather than because they’re less capable (and how many were actually doing all the reading in the old days?).

- Besides, distraction is relative: to be distracted from one thing is to attend to another. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1mcfce76jmae8r04prbjtw))
- What is doomscrolling if not avid reading? If people are failing to focus in some places, they’re clearly succeeding in others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1mcvsk378x796z6ykd7nqn))
- Years ago, in these pages, Alex Ross [described](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/04/25/secret-passage-alex-ross) Richard Wagner’s “Ring of the Nibelung,” a cycle of four operas spanning about fifteen hours, as, “arguably, the most ambitious work of art ever attempted” and “unlikely to have future rivals.” In 2023, Larian Studios swept the video-game awards with Baldur’s Gate 3, a noticeably Wagnerian affair with rival gods, magic rings, enchanted swords, and dragons. Two hundred and forty-eight actors and some four hundred developers worked on it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1megvy8qkq2dfaff4eatkn))
- Some may be misinformed, but they’re not uninformed: “Do your own research” is the mantra of the political periphery. Fragmentation, it turns out, yields subcultural depths. Silos are not shallows. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1mjmhcfdn80s309m79c9qn))
- Complaints about distraction are most audible from members of the knowledge class—journalists, artists, novelists, professors. Such people must summon creativity in long, unsupervised stretches, and so they are particularly vulnerable to online interruptions. Instagram vexes them in a way that it might not vex home health aides, retail salespeople, or fast-food employees, to name the three most common types of U.S. workers.

- Is the ostensible crisis of attention, at bottom, a crisis of authority? Is “People aren’t paying attention” just a dressed-up version of “People aren’t paying attention to *me*”? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1mm5kdz15zkvw2zh9n2nsz))
- It places the responsibility for communication on listeners, giving speakers license to be overlong, unclear, or self-indulgent. When someone calls for audiences to be more patient, I instinctively think, Alternatively, you could be less boring. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1mn2t9v4mxgcgapapk6yyv))
- Market forces have been stretching, squashing, spinning, and suppressing ideas for centuries. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1mpc1tgyf9z0b664mbjpb1))
- For Hayes, what makes the apps awful is that they operate without consent. They seize attention using tricks, leaving us helpless and stupefied. Yet even this argument, his most powerful, warrants caution. Our media have always done a weird dance with our desires. Although Hayes argues for the profound novelty of our predicament, the title of his book, “The Sirens’ Call,” alludes to a Homeric tale from antiquity, of songs too alluring to resist. This isn’t always unwelcome. Consider our highest words of praise for books—captivating, commanding, riveting, absorbing, enthralling. It’s a fantasy of surrendered agency. (“A page-turner”: the pages turn themselves.) Oddly, the thing we deplore in others, submission, is what we most want for ourselves.

- Which is unfortunate, because our relationships to our smartphones are far from healthy. The mediascape is becoming a stormy sea of anxiety, envy, delusion, and rage. Our attention is being redirected in surprising and often worrying ways. The overheating of discourse, the rise of conspiratorial thinking, the hollowing out of shared truths: all these trends are real and deserve careful thought. The panic over lost attention is, however, a distraction. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1mr0gr8jnyfjayer8a9e58))
