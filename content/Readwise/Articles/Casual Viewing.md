- Summary: Netflix has changed the film industry by prioritizing quantity over quality, allowing it to thrive without the traditional constraints of Hollywood. Unlike traditional studios, Netflix focuses on acquiring a wide range of content, often neglecting marketing and craft, leading to a perception of lower quality. This shift has disrupted the film business, making it harder for smaller, well-made films to compete.

## Highlights
- The more people watched films, the more money the studios made. With Netflix, however, audiences don’t pay for individual films. They pay a subscription to watch everything, and this has enabled a strange phenomenon to take root. Netflix’s movies don’t have to abide by any of the norms established over the history of cinema: they don’t have to be profitable, pretty, sexy, intelligent, funny, well-made, or anything else that pulls audiences into theater seats. Netflix’s audiences watch from their homes, on couches, in beds, on public transportation, and on toilets. Often they aren’t even watching.

- Above all, there were no ads. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnd16n0m08pq35wxz3nfkd7d))
- But its commitment to good filmmaking was short-lived. As with its DVD-rental business and its pivot into streaming, Netflix’s concern was scale, rather than the cinema it was scaling. Movies, as the founder had told Louie, were merely a means to an end: acquiring subscribers who paid for access to Netflix’s entire library of content every month.

- Film studios have always released duds: movies that fail to gain traction and are shuttled to the studios’ archives, where they disappear into obscurity. Until recently, for most studios, a forgotten film was a sign of failure. But Netflix, uniquely, seemed to relish making its films vanish as soon as they were released, dumping them onto its platform and doing as little as possible to distinguish one from the next. “Your film ends up as a thumbnail, and culturally it doesn’t make a splash. It’s not the same,” one producer with movies on Netflix told me. “Unless you’re Scorsese or something, the streamers don’t craft custom bespoke marketing campaigns for these films.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnd1hsvkbk1gaq7kz26ybemg))
- Unlike those films, Netflix’s movies still exist and can be watched on their website. But for the most part they aren’t. If Netflix’s executives learned anything from indie film it was this: on the platform, you didn’t need to make a hit to succeed. You didn’t even need your film to be remembered. You just needed, in Greenberg’s words, “enough of everything to attract anyone.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnd1kfqdgr9xbbddvac97cnv))
- In documentaries, too, executives shifted to conventional feed. “It’s not enough to do something that a few million people might really love when you’re trying to reach twenty-five million people or fifty million people,” a former Netflix executive told the journalist Reeves Wiedeman in a 2023 article in about the documentary streaming “boom.” “A lot of documentaries — I would say the majority of documentaries — don’t meet that bar.” So what did? Grisly true crime, garish cult exposés, celebrity hagiography, sports and food miniseries, pop science, and pets. Netflix’s documentary slate quickly became a supermarket aisle of tabloid magazines.

- The difference between Netflix and its predecessors is that the older studios had a business model that rewarded cinematic expertise and craft. Netflix, on the other hand, is staffed by unsophisticated executives who have no plan for their movies and view them with contempt.

- Netflix’s greatest innovation was that it found a way around this uncertainty: it provided a platform on which there are no failures, where everything works. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnd24hwmqzfmyk855zza4zbj))
- This is an important milestone for the largest Hollywood studios as they all set their sights on integrating artificial intelligence into their productions. In March, news outlets reported that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had held meetings with top studios to showcase his company’s text-to-video generator, Sora. Clips generated by Sora that circulated online alternated between drone shots of cityscapes that look ripped from video-game cut scenes and animals rendered in the 3D animated style common to Hollywood productions today. Streaming platforms are the only place where this garbage makes any sense — a place where it would never be watched at all.

- by insulating their films from failure, the streamers have destroyed the meaning of success. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnd25qnm5vrwncabespr6ebh))
- Netflix is first and foremost a television company, one whose recent business strategies have made the company resemble the cable providers it’s tried to make irrelevant. Netflix is no longer the cheap service that freed cable subscribers from the tyranny of the bundle. The company’s standard subscription price has risen almost 100 percent over the past thirteen years, and any cord-cutter who wants access to the major networks’ latest shows must subscribe to several streaming platforms, whose prices have also shot up. Netflix is also no longer ad-free, as the company launched a lower-cost, ad-supported subscription tier in 2022. (When the streamer debuted its ad tier, it sought to charge advertisers around $65 to reach one thousand viewers, an eye-watering sum on par with NFL games. Perhaps an indication that advertisers aren’t buying Netflix’s astounding viewership numbers, this dollar amount has since dropped by more than half.) Netflix is also no longer dedicated to giving subscribers purely on-demand content. Over the past several years, the streamer has flirted with live programming, and this year it made its first big commitment, inking a $5 billion, ten-year deal for the exclusive rights to stream WWE’s live flagship program, . It won’t be long before Netflix starts packaging shows into preprogrammed “channels” that run synchronously 24/7, and claiming it’s something brand new.

- But if Netflix now occupies a place in the market similar to cable companies, the business it’s most spiritually aligned with is Blockbuster: a widely disliked service staffed by people who know nothing about movies, stocked with thousands of titles to see, few of them worth watching.
