- Summary: Advertising doesn't just sway us through our emotions; it often works by raising awareness and making promises about products. A key method is cultural imprinting, where ads shape societal perceptions rather than just targeting individual feelings. This collective recognition leads us to believe in a product's value based on its visibility and the consensus around it.

## Highlights
- Even Pavlov's dogs weren't so easily manipulated: they actually received food after the arbitrary stimulus. If ads worked the same way — if a Coke employee approached you on the street offering you a free taste, then gave you a massage or handed you $5 — well then of course you'd learn to associate Coke with happiness.

- Almost every ad works, at least in part, by informing or reminding customers about a product. And if it makes a *memorable* impression, even better. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnewswnpc752akwpyt1ycbyk))
- Knowing (or sensing) how much money a company has thrown down for an ad campaign helps consumers distinguish between big, stable companies and smaller, struggling ones, or between products with a lot of internal support (from their parent companies) and products without such support.

- The same way an engagement ring is an honest token of a man's commitment to his future spouse, an expensive ad campaign is an honest token of a company's commitment to its product line. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnewwcbqsh3ke76wyzxz7any))
- Whatever's going on here, it's not about awareness, persuasion, promises, or honest signaling. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jney7zwbync0newgg1ske6v0))
- Cultural imprinting is the mechanism whereby an ad, rather than trying to change our minds individually, instead changes the *landscape of cultural meanings* — which in turn changes *how we are perceived by others* when we use a product.

- Of course cultural imprinting works better for some products than others. What a product "says" about you is only important insofar as other people will notice your use of it — i.e., if there's social or cultural signaling involved. But the class of products for which this is the case is surprisingly large. Beer, soft drinks, gum, every kind of food (think backyard barbecues). Restaurants, coffee shops, airlines. Cars, computers, clothing. Music, movies, and TV shows (think about the watercooler at work). Even household products send cultural signals, insofar as they'll be noticed when you invite friends over to your home. Any product enjoyed or discussed in the presence of your peers is ripe for cultural imprinting. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jneyaw34yhn1cfe2k9n1ytq0))
- In this way, cultural imprinting relies on the principle of **common knowledge**. For a fact to be [common knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)) among a group, it's not enough for everyone to know it. Everyone must also know *that everyone else knows it* — and know that they know that they know it... and so on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jneyy2aznz3hjpgq5nbmz6vx))
- Q: Have you ever seen an ad for bed sheets? Can you even name a brand of bed sheet? If ads work by emotional inception, wouldn't you expect to have seen at least a few ads trying to incept you with the idea that Brand X bed sheets are going to brighten your day?

- But clearly this is not what happens. Instead, brands carve out a relatively narrow slice of brand-identity space and occupy it for *decades*. And the cultural imprinting model explains why. Brands need to be relatively stable and put on a consistent "face" because they're used by consumers to send social messages, and if the brand makes too many different associations, (1) it dilutes the message that any one person might want to send, and (2) it makes people uncomfortable about associating *themselves* with a brand that jumps all over the place, firing different brand messages like a loose cannon.
