## Highlights
- But I like my friends! We can sympathize with each other and feel reassured that we’re not alone in our overeager consumption, denigrated self-control, and anxiety masked as ambition. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jp172gwhsqw9vt8d6ezq57de))
- Tabloids are only interesting as long as you’re always reading them; let your checkout-line-skimming lapse for a week and the thought of celebrity gossip seems pointless. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jp1734mk0yana2rp7b0pqjsj))
