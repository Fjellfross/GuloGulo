## Metadata
- Author: [[Jnerst]]
- Full Title: The Nerd as the Norm
- Category: #articles
- Summary: The author discusses how nerds are often seen as abnormal in society, while non-nerds, or "wambs," are prioritized and normalized. They argue for a world where nerdy traits are considered typical, rather than exotic or pathological. The article highlights the need to value both nerds and wambs equally, instead of viewing them as fundamentally different.
