- Summary: Supernormal stimuli are artificial triggers that can evoke stronger responses than natural ones, affecting both animals and humans. Examples include junk food, video games, and pornography, which can lead to addictive behaviors and impact our lives negatively. Awareness of these stimuli can help us manage our impulses and maintain balance in our daily activities.

- The solution, so it seems to me, is to simply avoid habituation. C.S. Lewis has some great thoughts on this: “Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is. After all, you find out the strength of the German army by fighting it, not by giving in. You find out the strength of the wind by trying to walk against it, not by lying down. A man who gives into temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been like an hour later.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnem64k4tkydzmffvy0415sz))
