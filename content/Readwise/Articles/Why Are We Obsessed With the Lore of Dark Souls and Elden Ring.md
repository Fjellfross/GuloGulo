## Highlights
- dialogue spent so much time thinking about the games and their stories even when I'm not playing them I actually find these games to often be really frustrating to play like some of these boss fights can just go screw themselves but the world design and stories and characters are so fascinating that no matter how frustrated I get with the gameplay I keep playing I can't stop playing until I've not only seen everything in the game but until I've seen it all like a dozen times I've never been this obsessed with the story of of any other video game no other game ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmndy0tjr4y278jhm4zmyssv))
- that is so compelling so fascinating that an entire cottage industry has arisen on the internet to dissect and discuss them and it's something that is not easy to imitate I've played a lot of games that are obviously trying to mimic the storytelling of Dark Souls that try to tell stories that are esoteric and obscure and Bleak but just completely miss the mark don't come anywhere close to getting their audiences as engaged as Dark Souls does I've spent a lot of time thinking about this Quest question what ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmne00wm59jfnn2nxz2agb1n))
- is it about the lore of Dark Souls and bloodborne and Elden ring that makes us so obsessed with them what do these stories have that all those imitators don't and I think I've finally actually come up with an answer I've narrowed it down to five specific elements in the world design the first element of world design I want to discuss is what I'm calling layered history okay so in Dark Souls one of the first areas you'll explore is called the undead Berg and from there you'll Ascend to the undead parish and there you'll find this huge ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmne19m9vv999t86nyhdmfmj))
- The design I want to discuss is what I'm calling layered history. Okay, so in Dark Souls, one of the first areas you'll explore is called the Undead Berg, and from there you'll ascend to the Undead Parish, and there you'll find this huge church. There's a lot of really interesting things going on here with the world design that I'll talk about more later in the essay, but for now, I just want to focus on how old this place feels. The Undead Berg and Undead Parish feel ancient to me. It feels like not only was this place constructed a really long time ago, but that society collapsed here a really long time ago. You do encounter some bits and pieces of the life that once thrived here. It's actually a very domestic setting in some ways. You will explore what look like ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmne27tdt1dcv8631en4sd6q))
- ordinary homes and markets, but the people who once lived here are all long gone. In the present, this settlement is a haunted place inhabited only by hollowed mindless guards who are guarding nothing but ruins, and by warriors and adventurers whose journeys ended in pitiful failure, perhaps hundreds of years ago. Yet their animated corpses continue to stalk the setting of their Failure, when you explore here, you already get a sense that you're exploring ancient history, but from this big church. If you cross this walkway, you'll end up in a much smaller and much more ruined church. This is an even older church than the already ancient one we explored before. There is a story here. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmne2zxmjw465n29wfgkfaa8))
- Once upon a time, this settlement grew too big and too prosperous for this cramped little church, so the people built that larger and more magnificent new church and then abandoned this one. This is a new layer of history that we've uncovered. Just like in real life, this land of Lordran is a place of deep history; monuments constructed on top of other monuments, old stories written on the backs of even older stories. But it doesn't stop there. If you descend from the old church, you'll end up in this shadowy forest called The Dark Root Garden, and here you'll find even older ruins. These ruins are so old that there is nothing left of them except their crumbling foundations. These are so ruined and so decayed that you can't even tell what these buildings once were. If you explore really thoroughly, you'll even be able to rescue this time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmne3yayk1xtbkjhkvjat6f1))
- Traveling maiden from a Crystal Golem, this is dusk and she hails from a long-forgotten age from a kingdom that was called Ulil, where magic, utterly unlike the magic of the present, once flourished. In her dialogue, you can get a glimpse of lost knowledge, forgotten ideas, a culture whose influence vanished from the world hundreds of years ago. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmne5f8xctwvwyvp1am27jyz))
- The setting of Dark Souls, this land of the ancient lords, is a setting with a deep and layered history. You get this sense that with the passing of the ages, many different kingdoms and cultures have come and gone here, risen and fallen, and been forgotten. If you go deep enough, you can actually go all the way back to the beginning, all the way back to the age of ancients, the origins of this world, before the rise of any kingdoms, before the rise of anything at all. Down, down, down in Ash Lake, the deepest part of the map, you can catch a glimpse of what this world looked like at the beginning. This is something that I absolutely love about exploring the world of Dark Souls. I love delving deeper and deeper into history, and you're always rewarded for going deeper. You'll always find. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmne642ep4rkb8v6knk54y6z))
- And of the Nox, a condemned people, who conspired against the gods themselves. And of the gruesome god-skin apostles who worshipped a figure known as the Gloam Queen. There is so much history in the Lands Between that is way older than the already very old history of Queen Marika and the Golden Order, but most of it is so ancient and so forgotten that all you can find are these tantalizing little bits and pieces—hints of a much larger story. This is something that a lot of Dark Souls imitators are missing. They'll have ancient settings full of ruins, but you'll only ever get to uncover that one surface layer of history, and maybe it is a compelling history, but it can never be as fascinating as the deep history of the Souls games—never as fascinating as getting to peel back layer after layer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnedgerdj58w4ehddg3hjwq))
- Of history, delving all the way down to the origin of the world, the births of the gods, passing lost kingdoms and forgotten cultures. On your descent, the settings of Dark Souls and Bloodborne and Elden Ring feel so old; their histories are so complicated and layered and mysterious. You're not just unraveling one thread of history; you're unraveling age upon age upon age of historical threads built on top of each other, inspiring and influencing each other. But what is even more important than those layers is the fact that we, the players, uncover those layers ourselves. That is another essential element of the world-building in these games. In Souls, instead of just being told the history of the setting, you have ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnefhgjbh389w01y3z9v89b))
- to go out and find it. A lot of fantasy RPG series do have settings with long and complicated histories. Elder Scrolls, The Witcher, Baldur's Gate— all of these series have kingdoms that have risen and fallen, champions that have been transformed into mythological heroes by the passing of the ages, world-shattering wars, whose scars form the bedrock of new thriving civilizations. All of these series and many others have really cool Lore has never hooked me in quite the same way that Dark Souls has. In a lot of other fantasy RPGs, the history of the setting is told to you in a very direct and straightforward manner. A lot of it comes through extensive dialogue with other characters. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnefpcd3tnaka2p3hn4zarh))
- Characters will tell you absolutely everything they know about the history of their worlds. These games often have literally hundreds of pages worth of dialogue, and much of that is made up of characters discussing the history of their kingdoms, their heroes, their cultures, and their religious beliefs, just telling you everything you could ever want to know about the lore of their respective games. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmneh2d01gr6ne0g9fcy1r29))
- But as cool as these stories can be, I don’t think a story told this way, through pages and pages of explicit exposition, can ever be as compelling as a story told the way FromSoftware's games do, through player-controlled discovery. In Bloodborne, when you take your first steps out into the twisted city of Yharnam, you know absolutely nothing about this setting or its history. You will wander around, lost and confused. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnehw4djy1mj0gkn4zckza6))
- You understand the setting through its visual design, through little snippets of dialogue from characters who never tell you everything they know, from item descriptions that reveal small pieces of culture and history. Eventually, you will find the path down to Old Yharnam completely on your own. No one will tell you where this entrance is; no one will ever tell you the history of this older, burned and forgotten district of the city. You have to put the pieces together on your own. You have to examine the simpler architecture here and realize, "Oh, this is simpler and cruder because it is older." You have to find a note that mentions the burning of Old Yharnam. You have to find hidden items and read hints in their descriptions. Then, you have to descend down into the underground labyrinth and figure out for yourself what its connection to the city above is, how the layers of history here link together. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnejk8rf2g3bq8p1snzz5c4))
- The layers of history build on top of each other on and on and on, up and up and up. In any other fantasy RPG, those things would just be told to you, but not in a Souls game. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnepngkmtwg1c026neq2qat))
- A smart thing that the Souls games do is attach a lot of the story to item descriptions. Every single item description in the game will include at least one small detail about the setting's history or some character's story. This way, players aren’t just searching for new items, but are also very literally searching for the lore. The more thoroughly you explore, the more details of the story you are rewarded with. If you’re someone who is obsessed with the lore of these games, it’s a really strong incentive to keep playing to search every nook and cranny, to go to places and try things you wouldn’t otherwise. For me, the most fun part of the gameplay of this series isn’t the action or the boss battles; it’s getting ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmneq293yheh2fewftx65tss))
- There are missing pieces; some of those missing pieces can be filled in by making educated guesses based on the pieces we do have. Like, no one in Bloodborne ever actually says why the human civilization collapsed, but we do know that in some kind of crazy ritual, they gave birth to a destructive undead miscarried infant god. So hey, that seems like a definite possible culprit. I can put those two pieces together on my own. But the really crazy thing about the Souls games is that some of those missing pieces — even a lot of those missing pieces — are completely and totally unknowable. Fans can theorize; we can make guesses, but we’ll never actually know, and that's not a mistake. That's by design. This is another one of those brilliant elements of world design that set the Souls lore apart from all other games: unknowability. Now a lot of people are frustrated by unknowability. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnet814wzn5wy2d5bkxchhn))
- Souls games. We just want more information, like how the heck is it possible that Queen Amica and Rigan are the same person? How did they have children together? How can they work at completely cross purposes while inhabiting the same body? It doesn’t make any sense. However, there is a whole genre of fiction, a genre which has been dramatically rising in popularity in recent years called weird fiction, and unknowability is a central element of weird fiction. Unknowable knowledge was all over the place in the fiction of H.P. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnewtj1sge82gcy8860pwp8))
- It's unsettling to think about how little we actually know about the basics of our reality and our perception of that reality. The unknowability of weird fiction taps into that anxiety, weaves it into our stories, and I think the Souls games actually tap into the same kind of thing. All of the Souls games are heavily inspired by weird fiction. These games are weird. Like Queen America is weird. Dude, these giant magical, slowly rotting fingers, which commune with an outer God through digit vibrations, are freaking weird. The spreading rot blossoms new alien life within the body of Melania, a cursed blessing from a different outer God of unclear or perhaps incomprehensible motivations. That's weird too. All of this is weird; all of these plot threads and characters involve unknowable mysteries and unanswerable questions like, where the heck did these giant fingers come from? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmneyz7c93vnqh4xqafter18))
- When and how did they split off from these three other giant fingers? Why do these fingers serve so hard for the golden order, and why do these fingers want to burn the universe down to a primordial state of lifeless chaos? What is going on here? But let's get back to the original The question of this essay was: why are we so obsessed with the lore of the Souls games? Unknowability is a big part of the answer. Humans are so driven by curiosity. We are not satisfied with, "Well, there just isn't an answer to this mystery." We will never stop searching for that answer—not until we find some satisfying explanation, even if we have to make up that explanation ourselves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnezbgm1sg4mmm07d343gek))
- The Berg area in Dark Souls has some really weird details in the environment that demonstrate another essential element of Souls world design. On the surface, the undead Berg looks like a pretty familiar place; it resembles many other medieval fantasy settings. You've got characters in chain mail and iron armor wielding swords and shields, as well as crossbows. You can see stone castle walls, cobblestone streets, and little houses full of crude wooden furniture. You can find cathedrals, ramparts, dragons, thieves, and merchants. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnf17pbrdxkj7s9zvy3m3hf))
- A lot of the things you would expect to find in a setting like this one, but on a closer look, it quickly becomes clear how different the undead Berg is from any other medieval fantasy setting. Because from a practical standpoint, if we're expected to believe that people actually lived ordinary lives in this place at some point, the undead Berg doesn’t make any sense at all. Its physical layout is completely insane. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnf1nwavtek2s94hrrsf9rp))
- The undead Berg was constructed hundreds of feet in the air on a series of massive castle ramparts and walls—defensive structures that don’t appear to be defending anything. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnf2eqzadayhasa8va7gp64))
- Have any purpose at all that end in seemingly random spots. The Undead Burg streets are crooked and contorted, twisted around on top of and underneath each other in bizarre and bewildering ways. If you were just a regular person, life would be very difficult here. Transportation would be nearly impossible; just getting around would be confusing and dangerous, even if there weren't any monsters around. There is no natural water source anywhere nearby, nowhere to grow, hunt, or forage for food. Yharnam, the Victorian-inspired urban setting of Bloodborne, has a lot of sim ilar peculiarities. Once again, on the surface, this is a familiar setting. It looks like a lot of other Victorian settings and a lot of other video games, but just like with the Undead Burg, as soon as you start to explore, things ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnf33d05engq35revsr331c))
- start getting weird. Once again, the physical layout is crooked and contorted, with streets twisted around on top of each other in confusing ways. There are odd little details, like seemingly ancient gravestones that are completely blocking much newer doorways. Did someone build a house in front of an old gravestone in such a way that it is Is it impossible to open the front door, or did they haul this old gravestone from somewhere else and intentionally block their own door with it? The big details are even stranger. Yarum, as a city, simply would not function. I cannot find any evidence anywhere of any commercial or industrial infrastructure anywhere in this city. Where are all of these firearms, carriages, and clothing, etc., manufactured in this city? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnf5a3803c62erfppb5f9tp))
- Where are they sold? Where is the food gathered and prepared? Where is the food sold or served? Where are all the hundreds of thousands of gallons of water that would be necessary to keep a city of this size alive? Every single well and fountain are dried up and appear to have been dry for decades. The canals are all dried up too. Yarum is a bizarre city made up exclusively of residential buildings packed tightly together with innumerable cathedrals, most of which don't appear to serve any specific religious purpose. There are all these pointless cathedrals which appear to have been built just for the sake of having one more cathedral in a city which already has way more cathedrals than anyone could ever need. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnf5qtbkjdmm711mqaz27np))
- Possibly, need it doesn’t make any sense. How would this city ever function as an actual city, like as a place where people actually live? You can find examples like these in every Souls game's settings that look normal on the outside, but as soon as you take a closer look, they just don’t make any sense at all. Sometimes, I’ve seen people criticize this style of world design; they call it a mistake, but it’s only a mistake if the developers were actually attempting to create a setting that made practical, real-world sense in the first place. And I don’t think that’s what FromSoftware was ever trying to do. FromSoftware doesn’t create real-world settings; they create unreal settings. They don’t create literal settings; instead, they create thematic settings. What I mean by that is that they create settings which are meant to convey a theme, or an idea, or a feeling, or an atmosphere rather than a setting that’s actually practical or sensible. For example, in the Undead Berg, all those weird megalithic concentric defensive walls that don’t look like they’re defending anything aren’t even meant to be literally ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnf73htcqv28q9d11s6t4zw))
- defending anything; instead, they are Meant to convey this idea of strength and power, the thicker your castle walls are, and the more of them you have, the more powerful you are. And Lord is the site of great power. All of those seemingly purposeless cathedrals in Yarum, which don’t appear to be practical sites of religious worship, are meant to convey an idea of a city's population that has been gripped by a fanatical religion that has become such an overwhelming presence in their lives that it dominates everything, becoming cluttered and claustrophobic. This fanatical religion has actually choked all life in the city, and you can see that visually in the physical design of the city. Another interesting example is down in Old Deum. I’ve already talked a little bit about how Old Deum was burned down to prevent the spread of the Beast plague. However, everything in the lore, all of the dialogue and clues, strongly suggest that this burning happened a long time ago—years ago, decades ago— maybe even longer than that. However, when you explore Old Yarum, it’s still burning. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnf93ammf8jfkdk9fp2jg74))
- If you assume the developers are working thematically, these still-burning fires aren't meant to be taken seriously, but instead are meant to convey the idea of burning disaster—of the extremes the hunters were willing to go to to protect the rest of the city from the beast plague, you always have to be careful when you're examining small details in the settings of these games. You should always ask yourself, is this meant to be a literal detail or is this more of a thematic detail? There is a tension between what these settings look like and how they actually function. I call this tension "unreality" because it makes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnfbge9kexyz6hy3kcjrkq9))
- the world of these games feel sort of unreal, and it's the fourth essential world design element I want to examine in this essay. The sense of unreality isn't limited to just the physical settings of the games; unreality extends deep into the stories as well. These games look like they're set in a normal earthlike world where both physics and spirituality work the same way as they do in our world. But just like the way the Undead Berg looks like a normal medieval setting but actually isn’t, neither are the stories. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnfcf9kn9n1fdjkk1sypt66))
- Explain what I mean in Dark Souls. There's a lot of talk about Humanity. Item descriptions and characters are constantly talking about Humanity this and Humanity that. Now, in any other story, the word Humanity would mean something pretty simple; it would just refer to the human race. But that's not quite what the word means in Dark Souls. In Dark Souls, the term Humanity specifically refers to this literally Dark Soul that exists within all members of the human race of this world: a mysterious Dark Soul which exists alongside their normal Soul, unraveling the mystery of this extra Soul. The ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnfdka4ssz91wjedr0qgmyj))
- Nearly powerless, apparently, Queen Amica wasn't always a god, but we have no clue how she became one. There are other characters who are said to have the potential to become new gods, but it's never explained what those godly criteria are, except that it definitely requires the influence of something called an outer god, a being even stranger and even more powerful. Just like with humanity in Dark Souls, unraveling the mystery of godhood in Elden Ring is central to unraveling everything. The Souls games use ideas that on the surface initially seem like they're being used in the same familiar way as they are in other fantasy settings: humanity, godhood. But once you delve into the lore, you will discover that these familiar terms are being used to describe something completely alien and foreign and new. That's unreality in both the story and in the world building. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnfgr9h0pcpmyey2hhc3mfy))
- I call this last element "hostility and hope," which are two ideas that are closely tied together in these games. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnfkn12rx7qg2h14fn0vcmz))
- Let's start with hostility. The settings of these games are intensely hostile places; everything is trying to kill you. There are so few safe havens, so few friendly faces here compared to other fantasy RPGs. It feels like everything and everyone you meet wants to kill you. There is no diplomacy in these settings; no compromise. You can never talk or trick your way through any obstacle. These are kill or be killed worlds; it is vicious. I think this is part of why players tend to become so attached to the few friendly characters who do exist. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnfkx34nwgw4qscrap8kd8q))
- And this hostility extends beyond just the monsters; the setting itself is physically hostile to the player. I've already talked some about how twisting The convoluted and confusing layouts of the Undead Berg and Central Yharnam — well, a lot of these twists and turns are actually designed to kill you. You're supposed to get tricked by ambushes, trapped in impossible fights, and get thrown off walkways. The world itself is designed to kill you, and this extends into the lore as well. In Dark Souls, your player character is a Hollow, a bearer of the Dark Sign, a cursed and wretched creature hated by all human kingdoms. In this world, Hollows are hunted, killed, burned, tortured, imprisoned, and all of this is tied to that mystery of humanity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnfn0sq6ye5tsex03a3bwen))
- In Elden Ring, not only are you a member of a condemned people, stripped of their godly blessings, exiled from your home homeland for an unnamed sin, but you're also hated and spurned by the denizens of the lands between. But even among your kind, you are lesser, as the very first NPC you meet. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnfpwdnnnhkkqcqhrzxv0e1))
- Points out, you are a maiden. You are friendless; you have no guide and no companions. The monsters of these games want you dead. The world itself wants you dead, and even the story wants you dead. And not just you; the story wants all of the characters you meet dead too. The story is constantly killing off likable characters in miserable and heartbreaking ways. This is one of the easiest World Design elements for soulslike games to imitate. Just fill your video game world up with monsters, craft a level design that’s hard to navigate, full of ambushes and traps. Make the player character be born of some wretched and hated lineage. Kill off all the nice characters over the course of the story, and bam! There you go! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnfpy6jx0jvq7gf3jwq3ha0))
- Soulslikes are usually really good at crafting their own hostile worlds, but they often miss something else. The soul settings are really bleak and depressing places where almost nothing ever works out for anyone. Everyone you like dies; everything is terrible, except these settings are not hopeless. There are these faint little slivers of hope to be found in these settings. Let’s start with some of the characters in all In these games, there are characters who are so kindhearted, so compassionate, who just want to help. I haven't talked about Demon Souls yet in this video, but one of my all-time favorite characters in any of these games is Stockpile Thomas. This man who fled his home before the march of the demon fog and abandoned his wife and child in the process. Thomas feels ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnfrnem165rs7rvr2kmdkp5))
- For example, Elden Ring’s story ultimately becomes all about finding ways to fix, enhance, or even replace the grievous and authoritarian rule of The golden order throughout the game, you see all these terrible things the golden order has done, all these terrible ways that innocent people have been treated under this rule, but you are given several options with which to repair that order, to make it fairer or to even cast the whole thing aside and build something new in its place. Elden Ring is ultimately a hopeful story about repairing a broken world, and this is something that I think a lot of Souls likes are missing. They do a great job of imitating the bleakness and the misery and the hostility, but they're missing the lightness, the kindness, the silliness and the hope. The Souls games are famous for their depressing stories, but it's actually the often-overlooked glimmers of hope that make them truly great stories. So there it is. Those are the five elements of world design that I think explain what makes us so obsessed with Souls lore: layered history, player-driven discovery, unknowability, unreality, and hostility mixed with hope. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnft40h6s93azwe06jmzgsx))
- In these games, we explore ancient settings with deep layers of history, and we discover those layers on our own, by our own volition. Those layers are full of Unknowable mysteries drive us to keep searching through medieval kingdoms and Victorian cities that never feel quite real. Real, hostile settings that are trying to kill us, but which at their core hide these little glimmers of hope. Through this combination of elements, FromSoftware has crafted some of the most compelling and most fascinating settings anywhere in video games. Settings which I will never get tired of returning to. This was a really fun essay for me to write. I love the stories of the Souls games and I love talking about them. I don't know if ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnftn8mhdvfftna25shbs31))
- anyone else still cares about the lore of older games like Dark Souls and Bloodborne anymore, but I do. I think I'm going to keep making more videos about them. One thing I didn't talk about much in this essay is that every single Souls game is set in a post-apocalyptic world. All of these games are set in dead worlds that have been devastated by disaster and catastrophe. I think the next Souls essay I write will be focused on that. Why are the writers at From Software so attracted to that kind of post-apocalyptic setting? Why are we as players attracted to it? What effect does What impact does it have on the story? What narrative themes can you explore in this sort of setting? What are its limitations? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmnfvptn1hf88gyjybhr8hqx))
