Why Necromancy Doesn't Exist is a fantasy Micro-RPG about magic, taxonomy, and petty academic disagreements. If you like making arguments for the sake of making arguments, compiling evidence to support a clearly ridiculous claim, or having in-depth discussions about fake things that don't matter -- well, that's what this game is about.
