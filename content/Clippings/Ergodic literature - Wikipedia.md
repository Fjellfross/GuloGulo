This article is about the literary neologism. For other uses, see [Ergodic (disambiguation)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_\(disambiguation\) "Ergodic (disambiguation)").

**Ergodic literature** is a term [coined](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism "Neologism") by [Espen J. Aarseth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espen_J._Aarseth "Espen J. Aarseth") in his 1997 book *Cybertextâ€”Perspectives on Ergodic Literature* to describe literature in which nontrivial effort is required for the reader to traverse the text. The term is derived from the [Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") words *ergon*, meaning "work", and *hodos*, meaning "path".[^cybertext-1] It is associated with the concept of [cybertext](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybertext "Cybertext") and describes a cybertextual process that includes a semiotic sequence that the concepts of "reading" do not account for.[^2]
