I'm at it yet again, this time in an attempt to help you gear up to fight your way through life.

With Your Shield or On It is a 42 card deck. Printed on 120# uncoated paper, inspired by an antique German oracle deck I spotted but sadly passed up in an antique store a long time ago. Inside the deck are 42 designs on shields hoping to help you make a battle plan to face your day-to-day or larger challenges.

Images within the deck are inspired by gravestone art, heraldry, tile designs, and more. They're all very personal to me and I hope you can interpret them and take them into your heart as well.

The cards are 2.5x3.75" and Includes a little booklet with instructions and some suggested very simple interpretations of the cards. I purposefully left a little room for you to write your own as you see fit.

I send out all of my work USPS once a week so it should be to you very soon!
