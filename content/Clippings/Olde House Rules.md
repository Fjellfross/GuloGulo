James started role-playing in the late 1970's (yes, he's really that old).  He liked the amateur look and feel of the earliest games because the crappy rule books and makeshift artwork left everything to the imagination.  His wife, Robyn, started playing in 2002, but was put off by the overly complex systems of the day.  After all, what good is a game that does all your imagining for you?  So together they developed Pits & Perils, an original old-school experience that recreates the earliest games right down to the artwork, influences (early 1970's), and writing style.  Olde House Rules puts imagination in charge - the way it should be!
