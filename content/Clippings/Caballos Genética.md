## Gray

A gray horse, like the name implies, will develop a gray coat, mane and tail. The word 'develop' is used because this horses won't be born gray, but instead will gray out with age. Younger horses are usually darker while older horses tend to be more white.

The gray gene is a dominant one, meaning that the horse only needs one copy in order to be gray (Gg or GG).
