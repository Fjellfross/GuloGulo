One of the things I have done when running [Primeval 2D6](https://jamiltron.itch.io/primeval-2d6) is to get rid of the more abstract notion of hit points, number of hits, etc. in favor of a more descriptive form of injuries.

This has coincided with my attempt to move all of my old school-styled gaming away from discussions of numbers and mechanics, and instead towards a discussion of the fiction as much as possible.

Now hit points are good for D&D’s abstraction level – a topic I often repeat. Combat isn’t the main focus, individual strikes and particular injuries are not the default interest of the system, so the abstraction performs its purpose. You also get a nice combination of effects – hit points are not only a collection of your stamina, luck, and health, but it also partially represents your fighting abilities. A well trained fighter may lose hit points while blocking a variety of blows, and is able to continue doing so because of their ability, expressed by their hit point pool increasing with level.

Nice features aside, I do sometimes see large buckets of points loosening the fictional impact of combat, and often there is a fatigue trying to figure out what each successful damage roll represents once characters start easily surviving a few. I also feel on shaky ground when trying to judge that characters have taken significant long-term injuries: the hit point system acts as an agreement, so jumping to dismemberment feels dissonant when combined with the abstract nature.

I have used and played about every form of wounding system under the sun – separated health from stamina, discrete wound categories, [flesh/grit](https://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/id-hit-that/), [cumulative wounds at 0hp](http://cavegirlgames.blogspot.com/2018/08/horrible-wounds-in-osr-games.html), etc. but recently I have decided to opt for the less is more approach – almost all of the wounds in [Primeval 2D6](https://jamiltron.itch.io/primeval-2d6) games have been ruled on the fly within the context that they have occurred.

Each instance will be a little different, but here is generally how it comes up in game. Whenever a character engages in combat, or has any other kind of a conflict where they may be injured I try to let the player know about this risk. Sometimes it is obvious, like a dire wolf leaping and snapping its jaws at the character, other times it is implied – the usual hints at a blade trap hidden in a tomb.

I’ll then figure out what aspects the character has to reduce this risk. The dire wolf may potentially tear the arm off of a failed roll in one circumstance, but maybe how the character is defending themselves, or the armor that they wear will reduce the potential wound down.

We’ll do the usual roll-off, and if the character fails then I ask them to write down the wound on their sheet. Sometimes this is super specific, other times its more nebulous – the character knows they took a blow but they don’t know just how bad it is yet. This may allow me to think up an injury with due time, or I will reserve another roll after the fact when they are checking on it to see just how severe it became.

I often think of wounds in three categories, but I try not to formalize this. There are light wounds that can probably be bandaged up or “walked off” with time, there are moderate wounds that should have someone attend to with significant forms of rest, and there are severe wounds which pose a threat to the character’s life and if they survive will probably affect them for the rest of their days. Then there is obviously a mortal wound category beyond this.

I don’t formalize this because I still want to leave wounds somewhat nebulous and up to discretion. The last thing I want to do is thoroughly determine if a blow from a club is a light or significant and come up with a subsystem that can be gamed through to alleviate it. I want us to be open to playing out these effects at the table, and have them resolve or degrade as the fiction demands.

Often characters who are wounded will suffer the risk of death whenever they make additional rolls, but much like the above – I do not want to say that this is *always* the case, its just a framework of thinking I use because it feels right to me, and often seems to coincide with fictional threats. But it is not something I am going to codify.

For monsters I follow pretty much a similar formula for characters. If a creature is such that in D&D I would have allocated a lot of hit points to them, I will instead referee conflicts such that the chance of injury to the creature is particularly low. For example, a dragon could be put down with a strike or two from a hefty weapon, but its armor and size is such that it will have a very small chance of risking injury most of the time. The fun is then allowing the characters to discover the means to deal with their foe, rather than allowing a whittling down of hit points.

Sometimes I will cheat and just outright give certain creatures more “wounds” so to speak, so I admit I am a bit of a hypocrite, but like I said above hits can be a useful abstraction, and I’ll use every tool in my toolbox when appropriate.

Let me know what you think of this method, and how you like handling injuries and the like in your games. Thank you for reading!
