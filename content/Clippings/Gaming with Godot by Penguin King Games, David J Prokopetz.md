*Gaming with Godot* is a compendium of fifty tabletop RPG supplements – playbooks, scenarios, rules modules, and other miscellanea – by 48 different authors, with a catch: none of the games the material is written for actually exist. Entries run the gamut from transdimensional diners, to polyamorous starships, to a character class which can only be taken by a character who has killed God, each one offering a tiny glimpse of what tabletop roleplaying might look like in a world very slightly askew of our own.

Material for this anthology is taken from a discussion thread on the editor's Tumblr blog throughout May of 2021; entries are reproduced in this volume by their respective authors' gracious permission. The original thread can be found at the link below:
