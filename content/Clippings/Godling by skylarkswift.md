***Godling*** is a storytelling mini-TTRPG about the formation of gods, faith, myth, and parenting. Using the booklet, a 54 count deck of cards, and a coin, you and a partner will play as an infant god and the mortal trying to raise them.

**Introduction:**  

*This is a game about an infant god and a mortal who attempts to raise them. The purpose of the game is to tell a story, focused on the relationship between the mortal and the growing divine. The questions of the game are intended to guide your story, and may be interpreted literally or abstractly as it suits the story you tell. Godling is a game inspired by the vast and terrible nature of gods, the things us mortals want from them, and the crafting of myth and faith. It is also a game inspired by the act of parenting, and all of the wonder and the grievous harm it is able to bring; the balance between vital yet impressionable youth and deeply beautiful, deeply flawed, deeply *human* experience.*
