Welcome to the Wii Vault. This Vault contains every known Wii disc in the world, synchronized nightly with [Redump](http://redump.org/). To play them you'll need an emulator from the [Emulation Lair](https://vimm.net/?p=emulate).

All downloads are in .7z format and can be opened with the free tool [7-Zip](http://7-zip.org/).  
All games are in .wbfs format built with [Wiimms ISO Tools](https://wit.wiimm.de/) and can be restored to ISO with [NKit](https://vimm.net/vault/?p=nkit).  
Games are also in .rvz format built with [NKit 2](https://github.com/Nanook/NKit) and can be restored to ISO with [Dolphin](https://dolphin-emu.org/).  
Disc and cover scans are provided by [GameTDB](https://www.gametdb.com/).
