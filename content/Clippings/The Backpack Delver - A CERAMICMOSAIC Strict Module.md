This is a simple concept for an inventory-based system for solving problems.

This would probably be great in a dungeon crawl scenario, and it doesn't require dice.

I do not include objective mechanics on purpose. I want you to fill the gaps for your game of choice, or even use this as a game system on itself.

## Backpack

You have a backpack. It has six Containers and each Container has 3 Slots.

Each Container can carry up to 3 pieces of Gear, as long as their total combined Size doesn't fill more than 3 slots.

The example below has a Big Sharp Sword, in Container 1. It fills all 3 Slots.

Container 2 has one Lantern, Size 1, and two units of Oil, each size 1.

Container 3 has a Long Rope, filling 2 Slots and Spikes, filling 1 spot.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | big | sharp | sword |
| 2 | lantern | oil | oil |
| 3 | long | rope | spikes |
| 4 | five | foot | pole |
| 5 | large | shield | helmet |
| 6 | trusty | armour | rations |

## Objects

An Object has a Size from 1 to 3, filling that many Slots in a Container.

Objects are always at least one Noun, plus one or two Qualities. Each word fills a Slot.

Examples:

- Sword (one slot)
- Spacious Comfortable Tent (3 slots)
- Sturdy Boots (2 slots)
- Light Spear Axe (3 slots)
- Burning Courage

Objects that can be bundled count as a single slot when sensible.

- Steel Spikes
- Arrows
- Delicious Rations
- Gold Coins Aplenty

Objects are assumed to be of adequate quality for the setting established. So in a bronze age game, writing in a "Bronze Axe" is redundant. Write Qualities that matter.

Characters are also assumed to have basic personal belongings appropriate to the setting, such as clothes and some neglectable objects. Write in those things only if they are unique or relevant.

- Scholar Ring
- Tough Jacket
- Expensive Looking Clothes

Objects can represent trait or skills. They are subject to the same rules, as other Objects. It is assumed that you have any negligible tool to allow you to use that skill or trait once, if sensible.

- accomplished linguist
- charisma
- very strong will
- petulant confidence

## Characterization

The things you carry inform important things about a character, regarding what and how they got what they have.

A character carrying only tangible tools may be seen as careful and practical, while a character that brings only traits and skills may be seen as daring or foolish. The quality of those thins may inform social class, while other details may inform cultural background.

## Resourcefulness

A track that allows a character to avoid item breakage or loss.

Use Resourcefulness when you would damage an Object or when you would spend it so that you can preserve them for longer.

You can also use Resourcefulness to combine two or more Objects to come up with new solutions. The more objects you combine, the more it costs.

## Luck

Luck is a track you can use to find just what you need when you need it. Use Luck and and throw an Object away to replace it for another, or for finding a single use Object to be used immediately. The more Luck is at play, the bigger the Object size. Luck allows your find to be a little less reasonable than usual.

## Resentment

Resentment abstracts the wear, tear, and loss that YOU suffer as you trudge through your delve.

You earn Resentment when:

- you use your Objects to help someone in their task
- you are inflicted harm or assault by others or by the hazards of the locale
- you fail or give up in surpassing a challenge or solving a problem, win a contest, or learn a new secret
- you lose an Object to Wear, Tear and Loss.

## Using Objects

When you wish to solve a problem, surpass a challenge, win a contest, or learn a new secret, declare what Object you are using.

Assume failure by default. You always fail when you do nothing or not enough.

When you employ an Object, you may achieve:

- Failure. Assume failure by default. You always fail when you do nothing or not enough.
- Failure, but... Sometimes you don't exactly get what you set out for, but you learn how you should tackle the problem or gain access to help or tools to try from a different angle.
- Success, but... You get what you set out for, no more.
- Success. It's great that you not only did it but also you didn't break a sweat.

## One-Use and Reusable

Some Objects are one-use: when you use them, they are gone unless you use your Resourcefulness or it makes sense that they wouldn't. When you spend these, erase them from your Backpack.

Example Objects: Potion, Oil, Ration, Torch.

Others are Reusable, in which case they just degrade, again unless you use your Resourcefulness or it makes sense that they wouldn't.

When Reusable Objects degrade, erase a quality word and replace it for its new state.

Examples:

- Big Sharp Sword, replace Big for Broken or Sharp for Dull. Perhaps you could use words like dented, cursed, etc. Sword could become Trash, Shard, etc.
- Long Rope, replace Long for for Shredded or Snapped.

Usually the qualities go before the noun, but it could be appropriate to go the other way.

Example:

- Five Foot Pole could become Five Broken Sticks.

Salvaging, Fixing, and Trading Objects

Reusables still fill the same amount of Slots, unless it is reasonable to salvage parts of the Object, reducing its Size. Use Resourcefulness to salvage a degrade Object.

Example:

- Burned Rope (2 slots) could become Rope (1 slot) as you salvage a still usable, sturdy section.

When in an appropriate location such as a workshop, some Objects may be fixed.

If the character would be skilled in the particular craft necessary for the object in question, use Resentment.

If someone else's service is required, the character may trade an Object, size for size as reasonable, or use Resourcefulness as appropriate.

When a characters wishes to acquire an Object to replace one they carry or to fill empty Slots, they may use Resourcefulness or trade something they have, size for size as reasonable.

## Conclusion

This CERAMIC/Mosaic Strict module is designed as a replacement or improvement for usual inventory mechanics, or as a stand-alone system. It should transport well for any setting or scenario that focuses on danger, scarcity, stress, and time constraints.

I used a version of this for one of the first iterations of [fantasypunk](https://thegiftofdice.itch.io/fantasypunk) but settled for something else.

Still, it's a pretty cool little system that can work with or without dice.
