[Buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/doodad)

Use this tool to reduce the file size of an image… but in a stylish old-school way.

It uses dithering to reduce the colors in an image, and places dots to emulate the missing shades.

Dithering is used to display images on screens with limited colors palettes — it has the modern advantage of making web pages load faster.

**Upload an image** and click the **preset buttons** to see what it can do.
