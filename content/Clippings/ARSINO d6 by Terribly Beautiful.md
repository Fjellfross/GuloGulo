## ARSINO d6 is a text-based alternative to rolling a six-sided die.

You might find this useful in situations where rolling a d6 isn't possible or convenient... such as a variety of professional contexts or while camping.

**Here is everything you need to know to use ARSINO d6 in your gaming:**

The letters A, R, S, I, N, O have a similar frequency in the English language (between 6.3% and 8%\*). By assigning a number to each letter (A:1, R:2, S:3, I:4, N:5, O:6), this can be used in lieu of rolling a six-sided die.   

1. Scan any piece of text for the next occurrence of  
A, R, S, I, N, O.
2. Read the number value of the first match you see.  
That’s your die roll.
3. To roll a new number, begin your next scan in a  
different place.

That's it. That's all you need to know. Now you can do cool and sneaky things like play through an OSR adventure module using nothing but the text of said adventure module as your oracle.
