universal rules for narrative gaming

***ACTIONS***

When you make a decisive action, roll 2D6 and look at the highest value.

- **6** = the *action succeeds* better than expected
- **4::5** = the *action succeeds* as expected; the referee makes a *soft move*
- **1::3** = the *action fails* and the referee makes a *hard move*

***modifying difficulty***

If the action is particularly difficult, as perhaps you might lack a necessary skill or be forced to rush, discard the first **6** you roll.

If the action is something you're particularly skilled at, you won't fail even if you roll **1::3**. The referee will still make a *hard move*.

***MOVES***

A *soft move* establishes or exploits a situation in the narrative.

*FOREX: Conch reloads their weapon but notices that their ammunition is running low. Another* soft move *might use up the last of the ammunition.*

A *hard move* immediately establishes and then exploits a situation.
