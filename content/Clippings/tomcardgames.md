Thomas Cardwell is a game designer based in Seattle. He strives to create games that introduce modern game design to a larger audience, provide simple frameworks for deep decision-making, and utilize games as a community-building tool. You can catch him in the wild cooking with his wife, hiking one of the many PNW trails, deadpanning the lyrics to “Roxanne” as a character in a tabletop RPG, and hosting playtesting nights with friends.
