These carnivorous mammals are the largest otters in the world, reaching lengths of up to 6 feet and weighing up to 75 pounds. They live in the Amazon, Orinoco, and La Plata river systems in South America.
- **Aggressive behavior**

Giant otters are very territorial and will fight back against jaguars, caimans, and large snakes that encroach on their space. They have complex communication, including up to 15 different vocalizations that serve as warning signals.

Predators of sea otters include **sharks and killer whales**. Sea otters dive or play dead when they sense danger, or may signal alarm by raising a forepaw. The Alaskan subspecies have predators on land such as coyotes or brown bears. Bald eagles have been observed swooping down and grabbing sea otter pups.
