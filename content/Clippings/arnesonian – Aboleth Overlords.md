So I’ve been fortunate to run a few playtests of my Primeval d6 (which I should probably “rename” to Primeval 2d6 since that’s pretty much all I roll) and I’ve been honing the kind of basic form of the system. I need to sit down and update my actual play document, but here’s how I’ve been running it lately and why I have made changes.

I’ve been getting more and more into what people are calling “pre-D&D” or Ancient School Roleplaying, basically something along the lines of Braunstein and Blackmoor.

If you want a primer on the details I recommend Norbert Matausch’s excellent [Play Worlds Not Rules](https://darkwormcolt.blogspot.com/2018/10/play-worlds-not-rules-juggling-ideas.html) series.

I’ve seen several systems in this style, three of my favorites are:

- [Landshut Rules](https://darkwormcolt.blogspot.com/p/landshut-rules.html)
- [Middle Earth Adventures](https://dreamingdragonslayer.wordpress.com/2020/04/19/middle-earth-adventures/)
- [Just Halberds](https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/Just_Halberds)
- [Sword & Backpack](https://swordandbackpack.tumblr.com/post/47031468824/sword-backpack-rpg-is-here-here-it-is-the)

I love all of these, and have even ran a two hour one shot of Landshut in Hyboria that was a lot of fun. Like any tinkering geek I have my own way of running this style of game, which I am currently calling “Primeval d6.”

I want to put together a standalone pdf of my rules, but I wanted to type up the current working set as I think about what I would add or take away.
